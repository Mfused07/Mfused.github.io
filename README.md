## Usage instructions

### 1. replace the images

- open the project in your file explorer, and navigate to `src/img`. there, you will see a bunch of images. these need
  to be replaced with your own images.

#### self.png

- add an image of yourself with the background removed, and cropped into a square. i know this seems picky, but the
  template is set up in a way that this is how it will look best :) I recommend using https://remove.bg to remove the
  background from your image. If this website wants to charge you for some reason, try searching "Remove Background AI"
  on Google, there are some free ones there :)
- Once you add it to this img folder, rename it to `self.png` (delete the old self.png so
  yours replaces it)
- if background removal is not an option for you, any image you use will automatically be made into a circle. for this
  reason, square images without too tall of an aspect-ratio work best.
- example with background removed:
### 2. edit `Info.js`

Next, open the project in your code editor. Navigate to `src/info/Info.js`. There are some instructions written in the
comments there, but I will go over it all here as well:
